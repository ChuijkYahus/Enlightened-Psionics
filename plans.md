Currently implemented:
- Get/set sentinel spell pieces

To do:
- Get sentinel tier piece (missing/basic/greater)
- Make sentinel pieces treat other-dimension sentinels as not present

Planned for later: 
- Allow hex to treat vector rulers as R/W iota storage
- Spell pieces to read/write compatible hex iotas
- Clarity/Clouding status effects modify psi regen rate

Maybe:
- Greater sentinel extends psi ambit
- Amethyst CAD components (phial battery?)
- Psi material hex trinkets or similar
- CAD battery as insulation against hex bloodcasting
