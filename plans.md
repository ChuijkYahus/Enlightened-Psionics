Currently implemented:
- Get/set sentinel spell pieces
- Get sentinel tier piece (missing/basic/greater)
- Greater sentinel extends psi ambit
- Clarity/Clouding status effects modify psi regen rate
- Spell pieces to write compatible hex iotas
- Allow hex to treat vector rulers as R/W iota storage

To do:
- Spell pieces to read compatible hex iotas
- Make iota read/write pieces actually error

Planned for later: 
- Hex pattern to read psi meter

Maybe:
- Amethyst CAD components (phial battery?)
- Psi material hex trinkets or similar
- CAD battery as insulation against hex bloodcasting
