Currently implemented:
- Get/set sentinel spell pieces
- Get sentinel tier piece (missing/basic/greater)
- Greater sentinel extends psi ambit
- Clarity/Clouding status effects modify psi regen rate
- Spell pieces to write compatible hex iotas
- Allow hex to treat vector rulers as R/W iota storage
- Helmet sensor that you can write vectors to via hex, and it will trigger the helmet's spell
- Spell piece to read vector from helmet
- Hex pattern to read iota from helmet
- Hex pattern to read psi meter
- Make spell pieces actually error
- Spell pieces to read compatible hex iotas
- A spell bullet that triggers a hex written to it like a trinket
- Spell pieces to suppress the above hex's cast effects, and the media report the bullet does

To do:
- Limitations for the trinket bullet's casting (eldritchcarmaker suggests ambit based on where the bullet is)
- Texture for trinket bullet, along with model variant for when written

Planned for later:
- More sensors for more iota types (and associated spell pieces)
- Non-placeholder textures for most spell pieces
- Reading from a CAD via Scribe's returns the list of its stored vectors
- Dedicated pattern to get the above when the CAD isn't in your hand
- Spell pieces to write to your helmet focus

Maybe:
- Amethyst CAD components (phial battery?)
- Psi material hex trinkets or similar
- CAD battery as insulation against hex bloodcasting
- The ability to write vector lists to CADs via Scribe's
